# Reaper-Envelope-to-CC
A ReaScript that can convert all envelope points into CC points on a MIDI item

This program depends on Lokasenna's GUI library: https://github.com/jalovatt/Lokasenna_GUI

This script converts all points in a specified envelope into points in a specified CC lane on a midi item. If you have volume/pitch automation done in your envelopes, and you would like that automation to be stored on the midi item itself, this script can be useful for you.

If you would like to try it, make sure you install Lokasenna's GUI library above and then you can just download this script and paste it wherever you keep your ReaScripts :)
